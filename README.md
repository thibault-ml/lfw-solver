Letters from Whitechapel solver
===============================

This is a pet project to discover Rust, so it may not be very "rusty".

I doubt there will ever be a need for this "solver", as it kills the point of the game. I just was curious to see the results of it.

It is also not very optimised as I am not sure which algorithm is best for such kind of thing.
